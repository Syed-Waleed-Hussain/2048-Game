## 📌 About the Game

This is a **console-based** implementation of the classic **2048 game**, written in **C**.  
The goal of the game is to **slide and merge tiles** to reach the **2048 tile**.

## 🎮 How to Play

- The game board consists of a **4x4 grid**.
- Use the following **commands** to move the tiles:

  - **`w`** → Move Up

  - **`a`** → Move Left  
  - **`d`** → Move Right  
  - **`n`** → Start a New Game
